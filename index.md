# Abstract

This study investigates the genetic expression patterns of toads from different regions (Seville and Madrid) and water levels (high water and low water) to understand regional adaptations and phenotypic plasticity.


# Exploring Developmental Plasticity in Spadefoot Toads

![Cover Image](/assets/cover.jpg)  
Welcome to my Master's Thesis project page! Here, I document my journey in exploring the developmental plasticity of Spadefoot Toads using RNA sequencing (RNAseq). This project aims to uncover the genetic underpinnings of how these fascinating creatures adapt and evolve.
