# Abstract

This study investigates the genetic expression patterns of toads from different regions (Seville and Madrid) submitted to different water levels (high water and low water) to understand regional adaptations, adaptability to dessication and phenotypic plasticity.


# Exploring Developmental Plasticity in Spadefoot Toads

Welcome to my Master's Thesis project page! Here, I document my journey in exploring the developmental plasticity of Spadefoot Toads using RNA sequencing (RNAseq). This project aims to uncover the genetic underpinnings of how these amphibians adapt and evolve.
