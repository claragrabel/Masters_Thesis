Thanks for visiting my Master's Thesis GitHub repository! 

Here, you will find the code and workflow I used for analyzing adaptive developmental plasticity in the spadefoot toad _Pelobates cultripes_, exploring gene expression changes and the mechanisms behind phenotypic plasticity in response to pond drying through RNA-seq. This work was carried out as part of the Master's degree in Omic Data Analysis and Systems Biology.
